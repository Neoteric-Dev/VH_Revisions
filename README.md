# Vault Hunters 3ʳᵈ Edition Tweaks

This is a compilation of configuration changes I have made to my personal [Vault
Hunters](https://vaulthunters.gg) instance. As I like making stuff I do
available to the public, so is this. For free, as usual.

Of course you can still [sponsor me on
Github](https://github.com/sponsors/alterNERDtive) or [buy me a
Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/S6S1DLYBS).

__In addition to the config changes in this repository I am and recommend 
running the accompanying mod__: https://git.alternerd.tv/the_vault-tweaks

I’m also running <https://github.com/radimous/SkinFighters> and
<https://github.com/radimous/FastVaultGear>.

_Current~~ly confirmed working on~~ version_: __3.13__

**This is largely untested since i don’t actually play VH right now. I didn’t 
see anything that would be cause for concern though.**

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of
   [the tweaks mod](https://git.alternerd.tv/the_vault-tweaks/releases/latest).
2. Clone or download this.
3. Copy the `config` and `scripts` folders into your instance’s `minecraft`
   folder, or however that one is called in the launcher you are using.
4. Either _remove `scripts/ChunkLoaders.zs`_ or install the
   [Chunk Loaders mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-loaders)
   and _update_ “SuperMartijn642's Core Lib” and “Trash Cans” to their latest
   versions.
5. Either _remove `scripts/SophisticatedStorage.zs`_ or install the
   [Sophisticated Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-storage)
   and [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)
   mods.
6. Either _remove `scripts/ae2addons.zs`_ or install the
   [Applied Botanics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-botanics-addon),
   [Applied Mekanistics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-mekanistics)
   and
   [AE2WtLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2-wireless-terminals/)
   mods.
7. Either _remove `scripts/RFToolsUtility.zs`_ or install the
   [RFTools Utility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools-utility)
   mod.

If you (or someone on your server) has unlocked Simple Storage Network or 
Weirding Gadgets, their research will be automatically replaced with 
Sophisticated Storage and Chunk Loaders respectively.

If you ever go back to using the default configs, you’ll have to remove that 
research from everyone first or NBT edit the names.

## Upgrading to a New Vault Hunters Version

1. __WAIT UNTIL I HAD A CHANCE TO UPDATE THE FILES__. Yes, that is important,
   since I need to manually check if anything has changed in all files that I
   have modified; otherwise you might break things.
2. Install the latest version of
   [the tweaks mod](https://git.alternerd.tv/the_vault-tweaks/releases/latest).
3. Pull or download this.
4. Copy files again.
5. Either _remove `scripts/ChunkLoaders.zs`_ or install the
   [Chunk Loaders mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-loaders)
   and _update_ “SuperMartijn642's Core Lib” and “Trash Cans” to their latest
   versions, again.
6. Either _remove `scripts/SophisticatedStorage.zs`_ or install the
   [Sophisticated Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-storage)
   and [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)
   mods.
7. Either _remove `scripts/ae2addons.zs`_ or install the
   [Applied Botanics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-botanics-addon),
   [Applied Mekanistics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-mekanistics)
   and
   [AE2WtLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2-wireless-terminals/)
   mods.
8. Either _remove `scripts/RFToolsUtility.zs`_ or install the
   [RFTools Utility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools-utility)
   mod.

## FAQ

__Q__: I don’t like how you changed the balance, it’s kind of cheating. Can you
give me the QoL changes only?

__A__: No. But you can figure out which files those are and only use them, and 
the mod has client/server config files that allow toggling all its features.

__Q__: Can you change some values for me? I’d like to do the balancing a little
differently!

__A__: No. Changing values once is trivial, doing it for 100 requests is
exhausting. Go over the files, fiddle for yourself (make a backup first). But
hey, I guess I’d do it if I got paid for it.

__Q__: How can I report issues?

__A__: Either open an issue here (preferred) or find me on the official Vault
Hunters Discord. For the latter, _DM me_ since discussing config changes that
affect the balance of the pack are not to be discussed there as per the server
rules.

## Fixes

* Fixed BCC version number, AGAIN. (AND AGAIN.) And again … oh! Again! And again 
  for 3.13!
* Fixed the “Intelligence” talent giving Illager damage at tier 4. Seems they 
  don’t even force 4 eyes when commiting …
* ~~Fixed “Wild” having a significantly higher weight than the other negative
  modifiers past level 20.~~ No longer exists as random modifier.
* Vault compass can once again be put in a backpack. The exploit that prompted
  the ban has been fixed, the ban not lifted.
* Totems of Undying stack in backpacks again. Since they no longer revive you,
  the unstackability is not necessary anymore.
* ~~Removed the Automatic Genius requirement from AE2 crafting terminals.~~ 
  Fixed in the official pack.
* Made AE2 Wireless Terminal compatible with curio slots, like the crafting
  variant.
* Removed Simple Storage Network’s recipes.
* Fixed trailing comma, rendering wooden chest enhancement altar requirements
  invalid.
* Pulverizing Stone → Gravel is now a thing. You want to use Silk Touch with 
  Pulverizing …
* ~~Mobs no longer have a chance to spawn with backpacks.~~ Fixed in the 
  official pack.
* ~~Made Sky Stone actually mineable in raw vaults.~~ Fixed in the official 
  pack.
* Reduced Mekanism QIO to 4 knowledge points like RS and AE2.
* ~~Lead Ingots now properly configured in the pool for Mekanism mod boxes; 
  would cause empty boxes before.~~ Fixed in the official pack.
* Added Uraninite Ore (Powah) to modded ore rooms in raw vaults.
* ~~Fixed BCC version number.~~ Fixed in the official pack.
* The Digital Miner’s Stone Generator Upgrade now correctly requires the Digital 
  Miner research.
* Fixed Witchery description to include the new 80% gating.
* Added missing top tier for Vein Miner specializations.
* Fixed affinities on jewels not having the correct weights.
* ~~Fixed “The Bounty Hunter” quest not being completable.~~ Fixed in the 
  official pack.

## Balance Changes

### Abilities

#### Hunter

* Halved cooldown times for all ranks.

#### Vein Miner

* Halved the block penalty for both specs. Instead of only getting a quarter of 
  the unspecced version, they now get to mine half of that again (4–32).

### Talents

#### Berserking

* Changed the health threshold to 50%.
* Halved the damage bonus.

Juggling around 20% HP is not very fun, especially if you can killed from 21% to 
0 in a single hit.

#### Last Stand

* Changed the health threshold to 50%.
* Changed the resistance bonus to 7/11/14/16%.

Juggling around 20% HP is not very fun, especially if you can killed from 21% to 
0 in a single hit.

The new buff values make it less likely to run over the resistance cap, wasting 
talent points. Additionally, resistance gets better the more you have; so the 
talent levels scale down.

#### Lucky Hit – Cleave

* Nerfed damage to 30/55/80%.

It’s still way too good. The new scaling makes putting more points into it feel 
less of a waste.

#### Toxic Reaction

* Nerfed proc chance to 30/50/60/75%.

Yes, it needed a nerf at 100%. No, 90% is not enough.

#### Sorcery

* Changed health threshold to 80%.
* Buffed mana regeneration bonus from 10–80% to 20–160%.

Having _full_ health as requirement is frustrating, especially since the game 
can show you as full even though you have taken a miniscule amount of damage, 
deactivating the talent.

At the same time it is ridiculously weak; I would prefer to make it 
multiplicative instead of additive (and nerf the values), but that requires code 
changes I am not willing to maintain. So flat buff it is.

#### Witchery

* ~~Changed mana threshold to 80%.~~ Now part of the base pack!

While keeping yourself at 100% mana is easier to manage than health, not being 
allowed to spend _any of it_ just feels bad.

### Expertises

#### Angel

* Removed the level requirement.

### Items

#### Stone of Jordan

* Moved to Trinket slot.

With Update 11 there is a clear distinction between “utility” trinkets 
(charm/red slot) and “power” trinkets (trinket/blue slot). Stone definitely 
increases your power level.

### Vault Balancing

#### Elixir Vaults

* Made glorp sizes more distinct.
* Made lvl 0–29 requirements slightly harder (25–33%).
* Made lvl 50+ requirements easier (~20%).
* Added lvl 75 tier with old lvl 50 requirements (this might or might not work 
  out of the box, testing needed).
* Yeeted the “new” lvl 80 tier as it’s obsolete with my changes.
* Added lvl 90 tier with increased requirements (1200–1600 → 1400–2000).
* Buffed Wooden Chest tier 1 from 0–3 to 1–3. I don’t think loot should ever 
  give flat 0.
* Nerfed Coin Stack tiers from 0–3, 4 to 0–1, 2–3 to compensate; also should 
  alleviate the issue that they roll multiple times and dominate most Elixir 
  rolls.

Mobs can still roll 0 glorp; I don’t quite like that either, but changing it 
would require major rebalancing of the entire thing.

#### Raw Vaults (Sky Vaults)

* ~~Moved Nether room to lvl 0.~~
* ~~Moved End room to lvl 20.~~
* Removed Dimensional Shard Ore from the modder ore resource rooms. It is 
literally useless in this pack.
* Moved modded ore room to lvl 0 to allow for easy no durability damage ores 
farming.

Rooms have been fixed in the official files.

#### Scavenger Vaults

* Lowered the maximum amount of an item you might need across the board.

### Mods

#### Applied Energistics

* Lowered the cost of 64 and 256k storage components.
* Removed Chiseled Quartz / Quartz Pillars from the Energy Cell recipe. Just any 
  Quartz block now. Like, wtf where they even thinking doing that recipe⁈

#### Botania

* Re-enabled Crafty Crate, simply as an alternative to compacting drawers.
* Re-enabled Gaia Ingot because I was curious. Can probably get some OP stuff
  though.
* Re-enabled dirt and water rods in Vaults. Seriously, they are just worse
  versions of infinite Unobtainium + Infinite Water Bucket.
* Orechids can now create modded ores from Stone and Deepslate (script courtesy
  of Kaptainwutax via Tangofrags’ Discord).
* ~~Re-enabled Redstone Fluxfield.~~ Now its own research in the official pack.
* Can now dupe Unobtanium. Why? Why not.

#### Chunk Loaders

* Added the Chunk Loaders mod to the Weirding Gadgets research, complete with
  vaultified recipes.
* Re-enabled AE2’s Spatial Anchor recipe and added to the Chunk Loaders 
  research.

#### Easy Villagers / Easy Piglins

* “Vaultified” the recipes for Breeder, Converter and Incubator to bring them
  in line with the rest of the EV recipes.
* Made the Trader block available without an unlock. Eliminates villager AI
  issues and improves server performance.
* Added Easy Piglins to the Easy Villagers research. Makes this slightly less of 
  a waste of points.

#### Mekanism

* Added recipe for crushing Ender Pearls to Ender Dust for feature parity with 
  Thermal Expansion.

#### ME Requester

* ~~Added the ME Requester mod (similar to what the RS Requester does).~~

Now part of the official pack!

#### Modular Routers

* Re-enabled the player module. (Be __careful__ with this one. The vault mod
  does … weird things to your inventory when you die. Most things are fixed by
  relogging.)

#### Refined Storage

* Reverted some of the crafting recipe changes introduced in update 5.
* Lowered the cost of 64k storage parts.

#### RFTools Utility

* Added to the pack.
* Vaultified the recipies.
* Removed the beacon/weather control stuff and some upgrades that cause crashes.

#### Sophisticated Backpacks

* Re-enabled Jukebox Upgrade. Because why the fuck is that even disabled in the 
  first place⁈

#### Sophisticated Storage

* It’s in now! Recipes vaultified.
* Replaces SSN research.
* Includes the Crafting Station mod to have an equivalent to SSN’s Storage 
  Request Table.
* Increased the upgrade slot count from 1/2/2/3/4 to 2/3/3/5/7 to match 
  Backpacks. We want this to replace those for bulk storage, no?

#### Thermal Expansion

* Can now pulverize Sky Stone into Sky Stone Dust.

### Miscellaneous Changes

#### Fortune and Vault Ores

* ~~Removed Vein Miner: Fortune.~~ Gone from the default pack.
* Removed the chance to roll 0 on breaking Vault Ores.

This removes the unfun mechanic of getting 0 off an ore. Still trying to find 
a way to make Fortune 3 act as Fortune 5. Moving Fortune to Expertise is even 
_worse_ than tying it to Vein Miner, IMO. I recommend just giving yourself 
2 extra expertise points in the meantime.

This is now a datapack thanks to @XanderHess!

#### Gear Crafting

* ~~Reverted the 10x proficiency gain nerf from a bunch of updates ago.~~
* ~~Removed the cap on total proficiency.~~

These have been integrated into the base balancing.

#### JEI Integration

* Up-to-date version of Freud’s JEI integration script for vault mod stuff.
* Removed all the outdated / uncraftable / not yet implemented vault stuff.

#### Jewels

* ~~Max size lowered to 40.~~ 35 in the base game now. Will evaluate later if 
  this stuff needs changing, with the way jewel cutting works now.
* Added Reaping jewels (at 20% the weight of Picking/Axing/Shovelling).

#### Mystery Eggs

* Added modded mob eggs to the mystery hostile egg:
  * Basalz (Thermal)
  * Blitz (Thermal)
  * Blizz (Thermal)
  * Wraith (Quark)
* Reduced chance for the worst offenders to show up.

#### Pickarang/Flamarang

* Made significantly cheaper. Because fuck gating essential tools behind Echo
  POGs just because someone™ doesn’t like them.
* Made compressed blocks found in factory room mineable again. Yes, that
  enables cheese. But otherwise you couldn’t use it on some blocks found in raw
  vault quarries.

#### Researches

* Raised the research cost of Automatic Genius to ~~10~~ 3. Might change again,
  not sure on the balancing of this one yet.
* Automatic Genius no longer requires unlocking everything else.
* Added research requirements for AE2 Things, AE 2 WTLib, Applied Botanics,
  Applied Mekanistics; if you do not run these mods, it shouldn’t have any
  effect.
* Lowered Big Backpack cost to 2 to bring it in line with small backpacks.
* Lowered Vaultar Automation research cost to 5.

#### Snapshot Modifiers (Beginner’s Grace, Casual mode, Afterlife, Phoenix)

* Removed gear durability damage penalty. I wish there was a way to bring “old”
  casual back, but there is not.

#### Soul Shards

* ~~Increased drop rate of soul shards across the board.~~

Has been matched (surpassed even) by official balance changes.

#### Spirit Extractor

* Lowered revival costs across the board.
* ~~Lowered death scaling.~~ Has been removed in the official pack.

#### Spore Blossom

* ~~added Botania transmutation recipes:~~
  * ~~Azalea → Flowering Azalea~~
  * ~~Flowering Azalea → Spore Blossom~~
  * ~~Spore Blossom → Azalea~~
* ~~added Phytogenic Insolator recipe~~

~~Currently the only way to farm Spore Blossoms is Botany Pots. That sucks.
Taking suggestions for other recipe ideas!~~

Those have been officially integrated into the mod pack! \o/

#### ~~Tooltips~~

~~Integrated the fan-made updated tooltips by a1qs.~~

Removed since those have not been updated for latest Vault Hunters.

#### Treasure Keys

Added Smithing Table recipes in addition to the Anvil ones. Purely because I’m 
lazy and want to be able to auto craft them.

#### Vanilla Recipes

* Added recipe for making Concrete in a crafting table with a water bucket, 
  similar to the Building Gadgets’ Dense Paste recipe added in Update 10.

#### Vault Alloy

* Added recipe: Vault Ingot + Vaulterite Ingot.

Vault Ingots are kinda useless right now otherwise.

#### Vault Diffuser

* Increased the payout for common scavenger items from 1 to 4.
